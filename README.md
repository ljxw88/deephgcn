# DeepHGCN
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of "DeepHGCN: Toward Deeper Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks".

### Directories
- `deephgcn`: code implementation for the proposed DeepHGCN model.
- `geooptplus`: the augmented geoopt package for implementing key features of HNN++.
- `layers`: including the implementation of proposed Hyperbolic Linear Layer, as well as other compared feature transformation methods in DeepHGCN paper.
- `notes`: miscellaneous visualizations and basic evaluations.

### Requirement
- geoopt ```(pip install geoopt)```
- networkx
- scikit-learn
